[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun 25 day coding challenge during Advent (leading up to Christmas)

I'm no longer good at writing code (some would argue I never really was!) but it's enjoyable to participate in this challenge.  I'm not proud of the code so hopefully you won't judge me from it.

I'd recommend this challenge for anyone.
